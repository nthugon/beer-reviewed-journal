    <h3>Nathan Hugon</h3>
    <p>I am a full-stack JavaScript developer with a
    background in education as an English teacher and a love for sourdough
    baking. Initially drawn to web development as a means to share my baking
    knowledge, I strive to write code that is modular, flexible, and easy
    to read. An accompanying passion for research drives my ability to find
    and create solutions to complex problems.</p>
